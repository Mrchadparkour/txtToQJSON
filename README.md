My project manager told me I need to add different questions to a multiple choice game.
So naturally I made a .txt to .json parser to handle the task.

Not over engineered at all, definitely impossible to spend 5mins copy and pasting. No time was wasted here.
Nope. None. Every second I spent on this thing was necessary.

All jokes aside, this was a fun excercise for reading and writing files in node.
